# JuCP.jl
JuMP extensions for constraint programming.

These extensions rely on [ConstraintProgrammingExtensions](https://github.com/dourouc05/ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl), an extension for [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl) providing several constraint-programming-oriented sets. 

For now, the new syntax can only be used with a patch applied on top of JuMP: [PR 2051](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl/pull/2051).
